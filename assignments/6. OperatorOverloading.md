hint1: See https://kotlinlang.org/docs/operator-overloading.html for the available operators
hint2: A ComplexNumber consists of a Real and imaginary part

1.  Create a class `ComplexNumber` that represents a complex number with real and imaginary components.
2.  Overload the `+` operator for the `ComplexNumber` class, so that it adds two complex numbers together. The result should be a new `ComplexNumber` with the sum of the real and imaginary components.
3.  Overload the `-` operator for the `ComplexNumber` class, so that it subtracts one complex number from another. The result should be a new `ComplexNumber` with the difference of the real and imaginary components.
4.  Create an infix operator `times` for the `ComplexNumber` class, so that it multiplies two complex numbers together. The result should be a new `ComplexNumber` with the product of the real and imaginary components.
5.  Use the overloaded operators to perform some basic arithmetic operations with complex numbers, and print the results to the console.

class ComplexNumber(val real: Double, val imag: Double) {
}
