1. Create a new Kotlin file in course.assignments.flow and add the following code to it:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val numbersFlow: Flow<Int> = (1..10).asFlow()
}
```

2. Create a new flow from the original flow which contains the doubled value
3. Create a new flow from the original flow which contains only the even numbers
4. Collect on all flows and print there values
