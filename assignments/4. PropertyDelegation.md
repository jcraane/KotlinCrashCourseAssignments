1. Create a Person class with a firstName and lastName property of type String. Declare them as var properties
2. Create a new instance of this Person and assign some values to firstname and lastname
3. Copy the following code

```kotlin
private class FileRepository(val fileName: String) {  
    private val properties = Properties()  
  
    init {  
        File(fileName).createNewFile()  
        val file = FileInputStream(fileName)  
        properties.load(file)  
        file.close()  
    }  
  
    fun get(key: String): String? {  
        return properties.getProperty(key)  
    }  
  
    fun set(key: String, value: String) {  
        properties.setProperty(key, value)  
        save()  
    }  
  
    fun remove(key: String) {  
        properties.remove(key)  
        save()  
    }  
  
    private fun save() {  
        val file = FileOutputStream(fileName)  
        properties.store(file, null)  
        file.close()  
    }  
}
```

4. The above code reads and writes from a properties file. We want to use this class in a custom property delegate to read and write the properties of the Person class to a properties file
5. Create a class FileRepositoryDelegate and add the getValue and setValue functions required for a custom property delegate which reads and writes the properties to a file using the FileRepository. 

Tip1: Just use a relative filename `data.properties` which is placed in the root of the project.
Tip2: Pass an instance of FileRepository to the constructor of the delegate
6. Run the program and observe the data.properties file
