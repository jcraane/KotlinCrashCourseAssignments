1.  Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and store it in a variable `numbers`.
2.  Use the `filter` operator to find all even numbers in the `numbers` list, and store the result in a new variable `evenNumbers`.
3.  Use the `map` operator to double each number in the `evenNumbers` list, and store the result in a new variable `doubledNumbers`.
4.  Use the `reduce` operator to find the sum of all numbers in the `doubledNumbers` list, and store the result in a new variable `sum`.
5.  Use the `sortedBy` operator to sort the `numbers` list in ascending order, and store the result in a new variable `sortedNumbers`.
6.  Print the `evenNumbers`, `doubledNumbers`, `sum`, and `sortedNumbers` variables to the console.
