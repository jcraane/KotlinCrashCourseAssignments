1. Open CoroutinesBasics.kt
2. Two functions are defined which returns a Customer and the orders of a customer
3. Write a main function which launches a coroutine and calls the getCustomer function. Tip:
4. The declaration of the main function should be as follows:

```suspend fun main() { /*your code here*/ }```

5. Write code which retrieves the orders of the customer. Print the orders to the console
6. Run the program and observe the result.
6. Add a println(Thread.currentThread().name) as the first statement in both functions
7. Run the program again. On which thread are both functions executed?
8. Add the following code to the getOrders function to make it run in a separate thread: return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { /*your code here */ return@withContext orders}
9. Run the program again and observe the threads again. What do you notice?
11. The .launch function returns a Job.
12. Assign the job to a variable named job and cancel the job after 1500 milliseconds.
13. Run the program again and observe the results
