1. Create a new file with a main function and copy the following class definition: data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

```kotlin
private data class Individual(val name: String, val age: Int)
```

2. Create two instances (person1 and person2) of the person class, both with a different name and the same age. Create a third one (person3) with the same data as person2.
3. Compare person1 and person2 and person2 and person3 using the == operator and print the results.
4. Print the results of the toString() invocation to the console
5. Modify the age of person1 by using the copy function and assign it to a variable
6. Destructure the name and age of person1 and print the results
7. Create a new data class Person2 (with constructor properties name and age) and with a var property named city of type String (not a constructor property)
8. Create an instance of Person2 (named person4) (also set the city) and print person4 to the console. What do you see?
9. Create person5 with the same properties as person4 but with a different city
10. Compare person4 and person5 and print the results. What do you see?
