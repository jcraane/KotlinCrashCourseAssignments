1.  Create a class `Row` that represents a row in a markdown table. A row should have a list of cells, which are represented as strings.
2.  Create a class `Table` that represents a markdown table. A table should have a list of rows, which are represented as `Row` objects.
3.  Add an extension function `row` to the `Table` class that allows you to add a new row to the table. The function should take a lambda expression that allows you to specify the cells in the row.
4.  Overload the `unuaryPlus` operator for the `Row` class, so that you can add cells to a row using the `+` operator. A cell has a String type.
5.  Overload the `unaryPlus` operator for the `Table` class, so that you can add rows to a table using the `+` operator.
6.  Add a `toString` method to the `Table` class that returns the markdown representation of the table. The markdown representation of a table should have a header row that specifies the column names, followed by the data rows.
7.  Create a top-level function `table` that takes a lambda expression that allows you to build a `Table` object. The function should return the resulting `Table` object.

Here is an example of how the type-safe builder could be used:

```kotlin
val table = table {
    row {
        +"Column 1"
        +"Column 2"
        +"Column 3"
    }
    row {
        +"Data 1"
        +"Data 2"
        +"Data 3"
    }
}

println(table)
// Output:
// | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
// | -------- | -------- | -------- |
// | Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
```
